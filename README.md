## Contents

- Authentic Images (Folder: Raphael authentic_images). This folder contains verified authentic images by Raphael. These images have been carefully selected to ensure they represent genuine works by the artist, excluding murals and controversial pieces. Accompanying the images is the Excel file 'Raphael authentic.xlsx' detailing the information available for each artwork, including catalogue raisonn√© numbers from Dussler and Meyer.

- Contrast Images (Folder: Raphael authentic_images). This folder includes images of non-authentic examples, categorized into three groups: followers, imitations and synthetic, whereby the synthetic images have been created with Stable Diffusion. Accompanying the images is the Excel file 'Raphael contrast.xlsx' with the corresponding details.
  
The contrast set is intentionally larger to envelope the authentic images during training, thus creating a clear boundary in the latent space between authentic and non-authentic images. By applying lower sample weights to the contrast images, we maintain an equal representation between authentic and contrast sets.
